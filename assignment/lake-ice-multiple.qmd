# Data

The data for this module are provided within the GitHub repository in the `data` sub-directory.

-   Data: `data/lake_ice_off_data.xlsx`
-   Metadata describing characteristics of the lake: `data/lake_metadata.json`

# How is lake-ice across the globe changing over time?

To answer this question, you need to use all of lakes in the doy-off dataset.

**Question 1:**

Present an analysis that evaluates how the rate of change in doy-off day-of-year is changing over time across the globe (i.e., the seven lakes listed above). You should address the following questions in your analysis

-   What is the mean annual rate of change in ice-off day of year?
-   What is the distribution of the slopes for the different lakes? Are they all the same sign?
-   What lake is showing the fastest rate of change in ice cover?
-   Do any of the following characteristics in the lake metadata relate in the to differences in the slope?
-   How do you handle years when no ice forms on a lake in your analysis?

The code you use to answer the questions must use skills introduced in the prior modules.

**Answer 1:**


# Rendering and committing

Remember to Render your document as HTML and comment+push to GitHub your code and rendered HTML that was created when you knitted the document. Your GitHub repository should have multiple commits with informative commit messages.
