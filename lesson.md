# Lake Ice Phenology Module

## Overview

Lakes are changing worldwide due to altered climate. Many lakes that were
historically frozen in the winter are now experiencing fewer days of ice cover
and earlier ice-off dates (or not even freezing at all). In this module, you
will explore long-term ice-off datasets from several lakes and use linear
regression to make predictions about ice-off dates in the future.

Phenology is the study of cyclic and seasonal natural phenomena, esp. in relation to climate and plant and animal life

## Questions

Are lakes losing ice earlier in the year?

## Ojectives

-   Understand how global climate change impacts local aquatic ecosystems
-   Analyze a long-term ice-off dataset with understanding of statistical
    differences, biological relevance, and sources of variation
-   Predict future scenarios of ice-off
-   Applying linear regression models
-   Develop skills using R for graphing and statistics
-   Generate Rmarkdown documents
-   Practice the data science workflow in the context of the Tidyverse.

## Requires

-   Tidyverse, specifically:

    -   mutate()

    -   group_by()

    -   ggplot()

    -   geom_line()

    -   geom_point()

    -   select()

    -   summarize()

    -   mean()

    -   filter()

    -   rename()

    -   head()

## Instructions

  - Open the notebook `assignment/lake-ice.Rmd` in RStudio
  - Work through the exercises described in the notebook.
  - `knit` + commit output files to GitHub

## Context

This module has been developed as the second module in a junior-level Environmental Data Science course at Virginia Tech.  The course is require for majors in the Environmental Data Science degree.  The course has a pre-requisite course that introduces students to tidyverse concepts.  It assumes that students have set of Git and GitHub and understand how to commit and push through Rstudio.

## Timeframe

2-weeks (4 75-minute class periods are allocated to this module)

## Background Reading

The background reading is embbed in the assignment Rmarkdown as links to the relevant sections of [R for Data Science book (2nd edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.
