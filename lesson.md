# Forest Inventory and Carbon Module

## Overview

Estimating carbon storage is important for quantifying the climate mitigation benefit provided by an ecosystem.  Carbon that is stored in an ecosystem is carbon that is not in the atmosphere and thus not contributing to climate change.  Carbon storage is quantified by adding up the carbon in different "stocks" of carbon within the ecosystem, with vegetation and soils being the most important stocks in most terrestrial ecosystems.  You will be calculating the stock of carbon in forest across the U.S. using individual tree measurements of diameter.

## Questions

How much carbon is stored in a forest ecosystem and how does it differ across the U.S.?

## Ojectives

### Environmental Learning objectives

- Describe how vegetation carbon stocks vary between different ecosystem types 
- Calculate carbon in trees from individual tree measurements of size
- Scale carbon estimates from the individual tree to the plot (i.e., a set area)

### Data Science Learning objectives

- Joining tables
- Accessing data from a database
- Developing and completing a data analysis plan.

## Instructions

  - Open the notebook `assignment/forest-inventory.Rmd` in RStudio
  - Work through the exercises described in the notebook.
  - `knit` + commit output files to GitHub

## Context

This module has been developed as the second module in a junior-level Environmental Data Science course at Virginia Tech.  The course is require for majors in the Environmental Data Science degree.  The course has a pre-requisite course that introduces students to tidyverse concepts.  It assumes that students have set of Git and GitHub and understand how to commit and push through Rstudio.

## Timeframe

2-weeks (4 75-minute class periods are allocated to this module)

## Background Reading

The background reading is embbed in the assignment Rmarkdown as links to the relevant sections of [R for Data Science book (2nd edition)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.
